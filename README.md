# EmotiCoin Trading üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: ANAGHA A

### Project Description
 EmotiCoin Trading ‚Äî Turn Your Feelings into Fortune
EmotiCoin is a playful emotion-based currency where your mood becomes your market power. Every time you share how you feel ‚Äî happy, sad, excited, or even ‚Äúmeh‚Äù ‚Äî you earn unique EmotiCoins. These coins can be ‚Äútraded‚Äù in a fun, non-serious marketplace of virtual rewards, silly perks, or bragging rights. The happier or rarer the mood, the more valuable the coin! In this emotional economy, the best traders aren‚Äôt stock brokers ‚Äî they‚Äôre mood makers.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People‚Äôs moods go to waste every day without ever earning them anything.
EmotiCoin turns your random feelings into a ridiculous currency you can brag about.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
By creating the world‚Äôs first mood-powered coin generator ‚Äî type your feelings, get fake money, and watch animated coins rain down like you just won the lottery of emotions.
